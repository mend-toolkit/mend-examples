## Additional Tips

### Caching the Unified Agent
The best practice with all of the above pipeline integrations is to have the [Unified Agent](https://docs.mend.io/bundle/unified_agent/page/getting_started_with_the_unified_agent.html#GettingStartedwiththeUnifiedAgent-DownloadingtheUnifiedAgent) downloaded onto the build's workspace during the build job, so that you always use the latest version.  

It is possible to utilize your CI tool's built-in caching functionality, so that you only download the latest version of the agent once every release.

In the following examples, the `wss-unified-agent.jar` artifact is stored in the pipeline's cache, and the Mend pipeline task first checks whether a newer version of the agent was published since the last time the agent was cached, and if so, it downloads the latest version to be cached instead, before proceeding to the scan itself.  

**Examples:**  

* [Generic Example](../../Scripts/Mend%20SCA/README.md#cache-the-latest-version-of-the-unified-agent)
* [GitLab Pipelines](./GitLab/Unified%20Agent/GitLab-cached-ua.yml)

## Publishing Mend's Logs From a Pipeline

The below snippets are used to upload Mend CLI logs as pipeline artifacts in order to share them with Mend Support/Field Team.
### Azure DevOps Pipelines

* Windows
```
- publish: c:\users\VssAdministrator\.mend\logs
  artifact: "Mend CLI Logs"
```

* Linux
```
- publish: ../../../.mend/logs
  artifact: "Mend CLI logs"
```

### GitHub Actions
Upload logs:
```
- name: 'Upload Mend CLI Logs'
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    with:
        name: "Mend CLI Logs"
        path: ~/.mend/logs
        retention-days: 1
```
Upload logs in case of failure:
```
- name: 'Upload Mend CLI Logs if failure'
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    if: failure()
    with:
        name: "Mend CLI Logs"
        path: ~/.mend/logs
        retention-days: 1
```
