#
# ******** Description ********
# mend dep will automatically use package managers and file system scanning to detect open source components.
# mend code will automatically detect languages and frameworks used in your projects to scan for code weaknesses.

# If you are NOT using a service user, and have multiple organizations, don't forget to scall the scope -s parameter to set the organization

name: 'mend-cli-scan'

# Define your own pipeline trigger here:
# Below is defined a trigger for scanning on a push to the main branch and scanning on a push to release branches.  This is considered an ideal time to scan so that an SBOM can be created for software releases and inventory is managed for released software.

- main
- release*
